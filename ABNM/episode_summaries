Ending
==========

There is a shadow organization that is selling body modifications illegally. 

Dixey's company (the main legit corporation) the main lobbyist company that made sure that mods became illegal *and* is behind the illegal trade and the illegal cyborg fighting ring. Motif: Dixie wants to become even wealthier (illegal is more money), but is also losing his mind because of all the nervous system modifications. Or maybe it's the megalomania. Or the cryogenic. Or the fact that he has been alive longer than most people know (he was unfrozen years)
