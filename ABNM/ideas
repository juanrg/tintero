----------------------------

- Synthetic meat completely replaces regular meat. 
    - Regular meat industry becomes decadent, expensive.
- Most forms of Cancer are treatable.
- Harmful to humans Bacteria are erradicted with synthetic virus (side effects in gut biome, triggers ecology imbalances). Viruses are targeted to 1 specific bacteria, but unexpected side effects makes several of related (and little known) bacterias to die.
