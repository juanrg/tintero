Summary
=======

Detective is part of a full bio sect. He dresses like a parody of a 1920's detective.

The people that give him the case are corrupt government officials that are trying to cover up a crime. They plan to strike his ego and lead him to a false conviction.

The victim is a former member of the detective’s sect, his teenage crush. In the sect her name was Maria, now her name is Ada IV. She is unrecognizable (even her gender) because she had installed “government spy” grade shape changing mods.

The false perpetrator is a drug trafficker that deals with illegal C-Mead. He is (unwittingly) part of an experiment of a government AI named Oracl. He isn’t being manipulated, just observed.  

Oracl’s AI target is to reduce crime. Oracl works with human crime specialists


Gameplay
========
