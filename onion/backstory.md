Onion boy background
====================

Worked in a rough farm only tending a huge farm of onion. He was given enough food to survive, barely.
The farm owners will show up in the village market.  

The Kingdom conquered new lands from barbarians that do not farm and calls all ambitious farmers to a land rush. 

The World
=========

Player starts in a tyranical Kingdom, dark ages style, mix of Germanic, French, Spanish and English, official Religion is "The Chain". 
Nobles/Warlords still have much more power than Religions. They are trying really hard that everyone calls them nobles, but Warlords
is still heard all over the Kingdom. 

The Player story starts with an incentivated colonization following a conquest of the people called "The Barbarians". They call themselves The Bosmensen, 
they are more advanced in botanics and foraging than the Kingdom, but because of their disdain for agriculture (it threatens their religion and culture) they lack numbers. 


Pretty much like in Medieval Europe, they are percieved and treated by The Kingdoms as little more than animals.  

Urdin Kingdom
-------------

Founded by Gonzalo Urdin almost 30 decades ago and gloriously led until his glorious passing after an heroic battle with diabetes.


Religions
=========

The Chain that Was Broken
-------------------------

Dark Ages Christianity/Islam, with a sprinkle of ruthless early capitalism. The deity is the Creator, the
Prophet is the Breaker of Chains. The Breaker rebuild the chains with The Chains of Freedom to unite all humanity in harmony under the same
Religion. Mayor difference with Abrahamic: Stealing is a mayor sin that is (officially) punishable by death. Reality is that the definition of stealing is bent often and the system is corrupt.

The Bosmensen religion
----------------------

Animist spirits of the forest. Similar to Norse, with less emphasis on war, similarities to Yoruba traditions. It is not a kind religion, it has plenty of reprobable practices. 

Bosmensen scarify their offpring based on strict social herarchy that determined who's tribe/family children, the order of birth (first, second, etc) and in consequence social status. As the Yoruba, 
they ritualisticly kill the "bad" twin. They have a druidic system where druid are both religious leaders and expert healers.
