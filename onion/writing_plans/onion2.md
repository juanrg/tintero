Chicken/Sheep wonders from previous owner. The rest of the animals are inside some nearby caves
Get to know the 9 neighbours (just the crazy ones, the rest for chapter 3):
	1 The Piece
	2 The half-breed barbarian man
		- His hidden "wife" in the wilds is an expert botanist (also known as witch)
	3 Reserved parcel (political influences, temptation to move the fence, more isolation)
	4 The Abusive Veteran and his Abused Wife. PTSD and temptations. They are going to have kids
	5 O'Flannigan, the boring, perfect, religious family
	6 Crazy Nick. Like Onion Boy but better in every aspect of farming.
	7 The Munchen brothers, 3 brothers that did the same trick as Onion Boy to get 6 parcels. The dad is with them. 
		- The sisters were given in marriage, the youngest brother misses his lil sister dearly
		- The wife died because of lack of care
	8 The elderly librarian and wife. They only had 2 daughters, all married/sold away. The wife is frail and will soon die. He poses as a wizard to scare superstitious and ignorant men like Onion Boy away.
